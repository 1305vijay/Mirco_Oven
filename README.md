🍽️ Micro Oven Project (PIC16F877A)

📝 Description

The Micro Oven Project is a simulation of a digital microwave oven system developed using the PIC16F877A microcontroller. This embedded system project replicates the core functionalities of a typical microwave oven including:

✅ Timer input

✅ cooking operations

✅ Start/Stop operations

✅ Heating countdown

✅ Buzzer alerts at the end of cooking

Designed and simulated using MPLAB X IDE, XC8 Compiler, and PICSimLab, the project showcases fundamental embedded concepts like keypad handling, LCD display interfacing, timers, and interrupt-based safety checks.

🔧 Key Features

⏱️ Set cooking time via keypad (e.g., 30 seconds, 1 minute)

▶️ Start/Stop button for user control

🔄 Countdown timer with display on LCD

🔔 Buzzer alert when cooking completes

💡 Optional LED for heating element indicator
